THIS REPOSITORY GOT MERGED, AND IS NOW OFFICIAL. THIS FORK IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED. ALL UPDATES WILL BE COMMITTED TO [THE OFFICIAL REINX CUSTOM SPLASH REPOSITORY](https://github.com/TheExpertNoob/Custom-Splash-Script-for-ReiNX).

This program is a simple GUI for the already existing Custom Splash Script for ReiNX. Other than the fact that I added a preview, not much is to be said. This is a component of [Unofficial ReiNX SD Stash Updater](https://github.com/lunalik2/Unofficial-ReiNX-SD-Stash-Updater). All credit goes to TheExpertNoob for creating the orginal script.

## How to use:
1. Install Python 3.5 or later

2. Run setup.bat

3. Download Custom Splash Script for ReiNX GUI, and run CustomSplash.pyw

4. Click "Select Image", and select the image you would like as your ReiNX splash

5. You will now be shown a preview of what the splash will look like when it is sized properly

6. You may choose another image, or if you are satisfied, click "Create Splash"

7. After about 2 seconds, your custom splash will be generated

8. Copy the "splash.bin" to your "ReiNX" folder on your sd card

9. Enjoy
